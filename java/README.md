Diagram Printer Refactoring Kata in Java
========================================

For exercise instructions see [top level README](../README.md)

## Running the tests
Run the test with coverage.
Highlight the part of the code that is not covered by the test.

## Objective
Create a test for the part of the code that is not covered by the test.

## Challenge
The `FlowchartDiagram` can't be instantiated directly.

## Solution
Use Adapt parameter pattern to safe-refactor the DiagramPrinter class until it is possible to create unit tests for the required code.
